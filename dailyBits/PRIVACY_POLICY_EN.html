    <h1>Privacy Policy for DailyBits</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 2024</p>

    <p>Welcome to DailyBits. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. By using DailyBits, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DailyBits is designed to be a private space for your thoughts. Our primary data collection philosophy is "local-first."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> All notes, journals, images, and recordings you create are stored exclusively on your local device by default. We do not have access to this content.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional WebDAV Sync:</strong> If you choose to enable WebDAV synchronization, your data will be transferred to and from your own third-party cloud service. We do not control or have access to your WebDAV server.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics & Crash Reporting:</strong> To improve our application, we may collect anonymous, non-personal identification information. This includes device type, operating system version, and crash logs through third-party services like Firebase Analytics and Sentry. This data is fully anonymized and cannot be used to identify you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide our services, DailyBits requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>: This permission is required to allow you to capture photos and embed them directly into your notes.</li>
        <li><code>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO</code>: This permission enables the voice-to-text feature, allowing you to dictate notes.</li>
        <li><code>android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> / <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>: These permissions are necessary to save your notes and media to your device's storage and to import files or images from your gallery.</li>
        <li><code>android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code> & <code>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code>: These are used to deliver reminders that you have set within the application.</li>
        <li><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>: Required for optional features like WebDAV synchronization and for sending anonymous crash reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring your information is secure. While your data is stored locally, we recommend using your device's security features (like screen lock) to prevent unauthorized access. For data synced via WebDAV, security depends on the provider you choose.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all your primary data is stored on your device, you have full control. You can access, modify, and delete your data at any time directly within the app.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
